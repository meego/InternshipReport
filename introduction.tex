\section{Introduction}

The division Federated Systems and Data of the Juelich Super Computing
Centre provides access to distributed resources like HPC systems and
data. This is done by implementing open standards and simplifying
usage and administration of these services. Therefor the division
is one of the core development partners of the UNICORE Grid middleware
and has members in the Research Data Alliance and the Open Grid Forum.

The research group High Productivity Data Processing works on solutions
to overcome problems and challenges occurring while handling 'big
data' problems. This can be splitted into three categories. 

\begin{enumerate} 	\item{\textbf{Investigate Generic Data Methods:}} How to overcome limitations of processing and analyzing large amounts of data ( e.g. in-memory databases, data privacy methods and query processing) 	\item{\textbf{Machine Learning:}} Use and extend serial or parallel machine learning techniques, like classification and clustering, to improve performance 	\item{\textbf{Smart Data Analytics Applications:}} Find and develop suitable applications for general data analysis 
\end{enumerate}

The goal of the internship is to build classification models for data
sets that show problems of 'big data' . Support Vector Machines are
the focused method, but other methods are considered as well. This
report shows the different problems and their solutions of several
approaches and implementations. \selectlanguage{british}%
